## Sample Job Description

**Senior Android Engineer — PayFlow (Series B Fintech, Tel Aviv)**

We're looking for a Senior Android Engineer to lead our mobile payments team (3-5 engineers). You'll own the Android client for our B2B payment processing platform.

**Requirements:**
- 5+ years Android development; Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
- Experience with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) for shared business logic
- Clean Architecture, modular codebase design
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Fastlane, or equivalent)
- Payment systems, financial APIs, or PCI-compliant environments
- Team leadership: mentoring, code reviews, sprint planning

## Gap Analysis

### Strong Matches

| JD Keyword | CV Evidence |
|---|---|
| Jetpack Compose | Listed in Core Skills; used across Tap and Alike roles |
| Clean Architecture | Explicitly listed; transformed monolith into 40+ modules at Alike |
| Modular codebase | 40+ feature modules at Alike; white-label SDK architecture at Shelfy |
| CI/CD pipelines | GitHub Actions + Fastlane in DevOps skills; weekly releases at Alike |
| Team leadership (3-5) | Led 3 engineers at Tap; grew team 2 to 6 at Shelfy |
| Mentoring & code reviews | Mentoring framework at Tap; mandatory PR reviews at Shelfy |

### Gaps / Weak Areas

| JD Keyword | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) | Not in CV | Flag as growth area; emphasize multi-module Kotlin expertise as adjacent skill |
| Payment systems / financial APIs | Partial | Billing Library is listed; Shelfy e-commerce platform is adjacent. Emphasize these connections explicitly |
| PCI compliance | Not in CV | Mention Keystore security experience as related; do not overstate |

### Emphasis Strategy

1. Lead with modular architecture and team leadership -- strongest overlap
2. Reframe Shelfy e-commerce SDK work toward payment/transaction relevance
3. Promote CI/CD and release management details (weekly cadence, Fastlane)
4. Acknowledge KMP honestly; position deep Kotlin and multi-module experience as a fast on-ramp

## Before/After: Professional Summary

**Before (Master):**
> Lead Android developer specializing in building scalable products, designing robust SDKs, and leading teams. Expert in bridging engineering and product, mentoring developers, and driving code quality across Android and backend systems.

**After (Tailored):**
> Lead Android engineer with 8+ years building modular, production-scale apps in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Experienced in SDK design for transaction-based platforms, CI/CD-driven release pipelines, and leading teams of 3-6 engineers with structured mentoring and code review practices.

**What changed:** Added years of experience, inserted JD keywords (modular, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, CI/CD), reframed SDK work toward transaction context, specified team size range matching the JD requirement.

## Before/After: Skills Ordering

**Before (Master — Android section):**
> Jetpack Compose, XML Views, Material Design, Material 3, Compose Navigation, MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture, Multi-Module, Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, Hilt, Dagger 2

**After (Tailored):**
> Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, Multi-Module, MVVM, MVI, Hilt, Dagger 2, Compose Navigation, Material Design, Material 3, XML Views

**What changed:** Kotlin and Jetpack Compose moved to front (top JD requirements). Clean Architecture and Multi-Module promoted. Java and TypeScript dropped -- irrelevant to this role and they dilute the Kotlin signal.

## Before/After: Bullet Points

**Bullet 1 — Architecture (Alike.Health)**

*Before:*
> Transformed a monolithic codebase into 40+ feature modules using Clean Architecture and MVVM; scaled without major refactors

*After:*
> Redesigned a monolithic Android app into 40+ feature modules with Clean Architecture and MVVM, enabling independent team ownership and scaling the codebase for parallel feature development

**Why:** Added "independent team ownership" and "parallel feature development" -- language that resonates with a team-lead role managing a modular codebase.

**Bullet 2 — CI/CD (Alike.Health)**

*Before:*
> Improved release cycle from monthly to weekly after adopting GrowthBook feature flagging and CI/CD pipeline

*After:*
> Built CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Fastlane, accelerating release cadence from monthly to weekly with feature-flagged rollouts via GrowthBook

**Why:** Made CI/CD tools explicit (GitHub Actions, Fastlane) to match JD keywords. "Feature-flagged rollouts" signals mature release practices relevant to fintech reliability expectations.

**Bullet 3 — SDK / Platform (Shelfy.io)**

*Before:*
> Designed and maintained the core Android SDK for a white-label e-commerce platform; SDK adopted by partners across 4 countries

*After:*
> Architected the core Android SDK for a white-label e-commerce transaction platform serving partners across 4 countries, handling product catalog, checkout, and payment integration flows

**Why:** Added "transaction platform" and "payment integration flows" to bridge e-commerce experience toward fintech relevance. Specific flow mentions (checkout, payment) demonstrate domain-adjacent depth.
